SECONDARY_SERVER_HOSTPORT=jConnect will try to connect to the server at this host and port number when both the primary server is down and the REQUEST_HA_SESSION property is true. Should be of the format\n  hostName:portNumber\nNote that if a client is using an LDAP server to provide connection information, an entry for this property will override any secondary server specified in the LDAP entries

ESCAPE_PROCESSING_DEFAULT=Determines whether or not jConnect should process SQL for JDBC escape syntax within Statements and PreparedStatements. The property defaults to true, and any setting for the property can be overridden with the setEscapeProcessing(boolean val) method

IMPLICIT_CURSOR_FETCH_SIZE=Use this property in conjunction with the SELECT_OPENS_CURSOR property to force jConnect to open a read-only cursor on every select query that is sent to the database. The cursor will have a fetch size of the value set in this property, unless overridden by the Statement.setFetchSize method

SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME=The name under which the server was registered with the Kerberos Distribution Center (KDC)

GSSMANAGER_CLASS=The GSSManager to be used for GSSAPI calls involving Kerberos. This property takes an Object value, and the Object can be either a String or an instance of org.ietf.jgss.GSSManager. If the user specifies a String, then jConnect expects that the String is the fully qualified class name of an Object that extends org.ietf.jgss.GSSManager. jConnect will take the String and use it in a call to Class.forName().newInstance(). If the Object is not a String, then it must be an instanceof GSSManager. jConnect then uses that GSSManager in its GSSAPI calls.

QUERY_TIMEOUT_CANCELS_ALL=Use this property if you wish to force jConnect to send a cancel to the database when we encounter a Statement timeout. This cancel will cancel all pending and Statements on the Connection."

CAPABILITY_TIME=When this property is set to false, jConnect will pass a base date of 01/01/1970 to ASE. If CAPABILITY_TIME is set to true, jConnect does not send a base date to ASE version 12.5.1 or later when JCONNECT_VERSION is set to 6. If you are using ASE datetime or smalldatetime columns to store time data, Sybase recommends that you keep CAPABILITY_TIME set to false.

SERVER_INITIATED_TRANSACTIONS=Allow Server to control transactions. By default the property is set to true and jConnect lets server start and control transactions by using transact sql "set chained on". If set to false, the transactions are started and controlled by jConnect by using transact sql "begin tran". It is recommended that you allow server to control the transactions.

ENCRYPT_PASSWORD=When this property is set to true, jConnect will encrypt passwords during login session. Otherwise passwords are sent as plain text.

TEXTSIZE=This property is set to 0 by default so that it is set to 32KB ( default) This is used for OpenSwitch Servers . This property is not documented.

SERVERTYPE=This property is used to set the Servertype ( OSW - openswitch ) when this is set to OSW the code path is differnet and the OPTIONCMD token is invoked.

CACHE_COLUMN_METADATA=This property is used cache column MetaData

CAPABILITY_WIDETABLE=Use this property to disable RowFormat2Token

DATABASE=Use this property to set Database Name

INTERNAL_QUERY_TIMEOUT=Use this property to set query timeout for internal jConnect statements to prevent application hangs.

DEFAULT_QUERY_TIMEOUT=Use this property to override default query timeout.

CRC=When this property is set to true, Update counts returned include cumilative counts including triggers executed by the statements. Default is false.

J2EE_TCK_COMPLIANT=This property when set to True , jConnect driver will be Compliant for CTS tests suite.

GET_COLUMN_LABEL_FOR_NAME=This property when set to True will allow column label to be returned as column name.

JCE_PROVIDER_CLASS=The Provider to be used for performing extended password encryption mechanisms. This property takes an Object value, and the Object can be either a String or an instance of java.security.Provider. If the user specifies a String, then jConnect expects that the String is the fully qualified class name of an Object that extends java.security.Provider. If not specified, then Sun JCE provider is used to perform encryption.

RETRY_WITH_NO_ENCRYPTION=This property when set to true, will attempt plain password login in case if encryption is not supported by a server.

ENABLE_BULK_LOAD=Allow the user to Bulk Copy during Batch inserts.

NEWPASSWORD=set the newpassword if the old password is expired.

PROMPT_FOR_NEWPASSWORD=when set to true it will open a dialog box to enter old/new password,(default is false).

ALLOW_LOADBALANCING=

ALLOW_CONTEXT_MIGRATION=

ALTERNATE_SERVER_NAME=The alternate server name for an ASA mirrored database. jConnect will use the ASA UDP discovery protocol to determine which ASA server instance is the current primary database.

IGNORE_WARNINGS=Set this to true to avoid some warnings. This can help in performance improvement.

OPTIMIZE_FOR_PERFORMANCE=Set this to true to enable a set of performance optimizations.

DELETE_WARNINGS_FROM_EXCEPTION_CHAIN=Set this to true to delete warnings from exception chain thrown from a Connection/Statement/ResultSet operation

JAVA_CHARSET_MAPPING=Set this to an overridden value from the existing mapping corresponding to the charset present in Iana

ENABLE_RAWBULK_INTERFACE=Set this to true along with ENABLE_BULK_LOAD property to send data as bytes for bulk insert.

EXECUTE_BATCH_PAST_ERRORS=Set this property true to continue processing the remaining commands in a batch once execution of a command fails.

SETMAXROWS_AFFECTS_SELECT_ONLY=When set to true, Statement.setMaxRows(int max) will only affect SELECT statements.

RELEASE_LOCKS_ON_CURSOR_CLOSE=Set this property true when user want to release shared lock when cursor is closed for any isolation level.

SEND_BATCHPARAMS_IMMEDIATE=When this property is set to true, jConnect starts sending the batch data as soon as PreparedStatement.addBatch() is executed.

HOMOGENEOUS_BATCH=When this property is set to true, jConnect uses the new batching protocol if the server is capable of managing it.

EARLY_BATCH_READ_THRESHOLD=Threshold on number of rows after which a reader thread should be started to drain out the responses from a batch.

OPTIMIZE_STRING_CONVERSIONS=Set this property to enforce string conversion without double check

SUPPRESS_CONTROL_TOKEN=Set this property true to suppress control token

SUPPRESS_PARAM_FORMAT=Set this property true to enable param format suppression feature

ENABLE_FUNCTIONALITY_GROUP=Set this property to 1 if a group of jConnect properties {Dynamic Prepare, Homogenous Batch, SQL Init String, Early Batch Read Threshold, Execute Batch Past Errors, Encrypt Password} have to  be set to true or false

STRIP_BLANKS=Set this property to true, if the return value for a char column that can take null values should strip blank spaces from the output.

INTERNAL_READ_BUFFER_LIMIT=Threshold on number of buffer interval object that can be present in virtual memory when reader thread is started. Values specified in % is considered as percentage of total virtual memory size else absolute value should have valid range with units KB/MB/GB.

CONNECTION_RETRY_COUNT=This is maximum number of attempts each server in the address-list is to be tried to be connected to in case of primary is down or being quiesced.

CONNECTION_RETRY_DELAY=Number of seconds to wait before trying to connect to next server in the address-list.

HADR_NOKILL=Set this property to TRUE to not to abort connection in HADR while primary is undergoing deactivation.

HADR_LIST_MAP=When set to TRUE on an HADR configured ASE, this will cause ASE to send the HADR address list to the application upon login as well as asynchronously when the  list undergoes modification.

CONNECT_READONLY=When set to TRUE, the client informs the server that only read-only queries will be executed on the server. This allows, for example, HADR configured ASE to let non-privileged users to login to 'standby' ASE servers in read-only mode.
